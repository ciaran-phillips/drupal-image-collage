-- SUMMARY --

This module takes a view with text and image fields, and displays it as a collage of images with the textual data displayed on hover and click.

It's based on the Views Vertical Tabs module created by Jibran Ijaz. The general structure of this project and interaction with the Views API is all part of the original module, though certain inner parts of the module have been changed quite significantly
